# Workflow: Drawing Logic

1. **Specification Scan**
   - Let the "illustrator" analyze the target skill file and extract the `description` tag.

2. **Visual Positioning**
   - Determine core symbols based on skill attributes (e.g., security maps to shield, logic maps to block).

3. **Vector Sketching**
   - Based on the extracted structure, auto-generate SVG geometric paths or visual placeholders. Plan background, skeleton, and detail layers.

4. **Aura Integration**
   - Apply Antigravity's signature dark mode palette and glow effects. Complete the final dashboard visual render.
